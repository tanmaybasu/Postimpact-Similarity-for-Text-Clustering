# Postimpact Similarity: A Similarity Measure for EffectiveGrouping of Unlabelled Text Using Spectral Clustering
A  similarity  measure  is  pro-posed  here  to  improve  the  performance  of  text  clus-tering using spectral method. The proposed similaritymeasure between two documents assigns a score basedon  their  content  similarity  and  their  individual  simi-larity with the shared neighbours over the corpus. Theeffectiveness of the proposed document similarity mea-sure has been tested for clustering of different standardcorpora using spectral clustering method.  Read the following paper for more information.
